# Open Dealer - Business Plan & Architecture

## Overview

Open Dealer is a SaaS platform that transforms automotive dealership data into LLM-ready, structured content that drives traffic and sales through AI-powered discovery. We solve the fundamental problem that dealership websites are not optimized for modern AI search and discovery, while providing a fully automated solution that requires zero ongoing human effort.

## Core Value Proposition

**"We automate your site's SEO and AI discoverability — zero human effort required."**

Instead of dealers hiring SEO agencies or managing complex technical implementations, Open Dealer provides a turnkey solution that:
- Automatically ingests and normalizes dealer inventory data
- Creates LLM-optimized structured content
- Ensures discoverability across all major AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot)
- Drives qualified traffic back to dealer websites
- Requires zero ongoing maintenance or human intervention

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem
1. **Dealer websites are not AI-ready**: Most dealership sites lack proper structured data, clean JSON-LD, and LLM-optimized content
2. **SEO is labor-intensive**: Traditional SEO requires ongoing manual work, content creation, and technical expertise
3. **AI discovery gap**: LLMs can't effectively find or understand dealer inventory, leading to missed sales opportunities
4. **Fragmented data**: Dealer data exists across multiple platforms (HomeNet, Dealer.com, etc.) but isn't unified or optimized

### The Solution
Open Dealer creates a centralized data stack that:
- Ingests data from all dealer platforms (HomeNet, Dealer.com, etc.)
- Normalizes and structures the data for AI consumption
- Provides clean, machine-readable endpoints for LLM discovery
- Automatically injects SEO-optimized structured data into dealer websites
- Ensures discoverability across all major AI platforms

## Business Model

### SaaS Subscription Model
- **Tier 1**: Basic LLM optimization (up to 100 vehicles) - $299/month

### Revenue Streams
1. **Monthly SaaS subscriptions** from dealerships
