# Open Dealer Scheduler - TODO

## Current Work
- [x] **COMPLETED: Core Infrastructure Fixes** - Fixed NPM token authentication, published schema v0.1.9, deployed Data API as serverless function
- [x] **COMPLETED: Schema Validation Fixes** - Fixed empty string handling for transmission, body_style, drivetrain fields
- [x] **COMPLETED: Data API Serverless Deployment** - Fixed Vercel deployment as serverless function, removed build script
- [x] **COMPLETED: Codebase Cleanup & Security** - Removed 30+ test scripts, replaced hardcoded tokens with Doppler environment variables
- [x] **COMPLETED: Enterprise-Grade Job Queue System** - Circuit breakers, conflict resolution, comprehensive monitoring
- [x] **COMPLETED: Enhanced URL Shortening** - Slashtag conflict resolution, unique generation, rate limiting
- [x] **COMPLETED: Product Detail Scraping Error Handling** - Comprehensive null checks, Promise.allSettled, graceful degradation
- [x] **COMPLETED: Job Queue Management** - Stuck job detection, intelligent retries, health monitoring
- [x] URL shortening system with Rebrandly integration
- [x] Asynchronous job queue architecture
- [x] Sitemap processor for RSM Honda
- [x] **COMPLETED: Apify Vehicle Scraper Actor** - Comprehensive vehicle data scraping with sitemap processing and page extraction
- [ ] **NEW: Test RSM Honda Data Processing** - Verify HomeNet data ingestion and vehicle storage with updated schema

## Next Steps
- [ ] **Test RSM Honda HomeNet Integration**: Verify HomeNet data ingestion with updated schema validation
- [ ] **Test Vehicle Storage**: Confirm vehicles are being stored in database without validation errors
- [ ] **Test Scraping Integration**: Verify Dealer.com scraping is working and storing enriched data
- [ ] **Apify Integration Testing**: Test the deployed actor with RSM Honda
- [ ] **Apify Scheduling**: Set up daily/weekly automated runs
- [ ] **Data API Webhook**: Create endpoint to receive Apify results automatically
- [ ] **Multi-Dealer Support**: Extend Apify actor for other Dealer.com dealerships
- [ ] Geocoding worker for dealers without location
- [ ] Data API: nearby search (lat,lng,radius) + distance in results
- [ ] Feeds/JSON-LD: offeredBy PostalAddress + GeoCoordinates
- [ ] Distribution: sitemaps per type + IndexNow pinger job
- [ ] Robots split: stack bots vs Google/Bing; add canonicals if needed
- [ ] Monitoring: queue depth/age tiles in CMS + bot logs dashboard

## Dealer.com Inventory Feed Investigation
- [x] **Verify RSM Honda inventory feed**: Check if the detailed JSON feed we discovered is still available
- [x] **Test other Dealer.com sites**: Verify if this feed architecture is consistent across all Dealer.com dealerships
- [x] **Assess feed efficiency**: Compare single JSON feed vs individual product detail page scraping
- [x] **Design async architecture**: If feed exists, create new batch process for inventory data ingestion
- [x] **Fallback strategy**: If feed unavailable, enhance product detail page scraping with Dealer.com object extraction

## Architecture Enhancements
- [x] **Primary**: Dealer.com inventory feed processor (if available)
- [x] **Secondary**: Enhanced product detail page scraper with Dealer.com object extraction
- [x] **Integration**: Connect inventory feed data with existing HomeNet data for comprehensive vehicle profiles
- [x] **Apify Integration**: Scalable, automated vehicle data scraping with comprehensive data extraction

## Apify Implementation Status
- [x] **Actor Development**: Complete vehicle scraper with sitemap processing
- [x] **Data Extraction**: VIN, make, model, year, pricing, features, images
- [x] **Configuration**: Flexible input parameters for different dealers
- [x] **Integration Scripts**: Process results and send to Data API
- [x] **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and integration guide
- [ ] **Deployment**: Deploy to Apify platform
- [ ] **Testing**: Verify with RSM Honda data
- [ ] **Scheduling**: Set up automated runs
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Track performance and data quality
